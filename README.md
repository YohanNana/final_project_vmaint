# Vehicle Maintenance System with Prediction and Analytics

A full-featured web application for vehicle owners and administrators to manage vehicle maintenance, receive intelligent predictions for upcoming services, visualize analytics, and control user data through a role-based dashboard.

---

## üìå Features

### üë§ User (Vehicle Owner)
- Register/Login securely
- Add / Edit / Delete vehicle records
- Track maintenance history with dates, costs, and mileage
- Receive predictions on upcoming maintenance based on input data
- View prediction reports and download them as PDF
- Visual analytics: service frequency, costs, mileage trends
- Notification system for upcoming services and alerts

### üß† Machine Learning Integration
- Prediction model using `RandomForest + SMOTE`
- Inputs: mileage, engine temperature, battery voltage, tire pressure, speed
- Output: Maintenance required (YES/NO) + confidence score
- Trigger notifications if maintenance is predicted as required

### üìä Admin Dashboard (admin@gmail.com only)
- View all registered users
- View all vehicles
- Delete or ban users
- View platform-wide statistics

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> The backend will run on: **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the Angular development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

> The frontend will run on: **[http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)**

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Notes

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure MongoDB is running locally or use MongoDB Atlas
* Backend must run on `localhost:5000` to align with Angular API calls
* Admin login uses:
  **Email:** `admin@gmail.com`
  **Password:** *(Set this during manual seeding or registration)*

---

## üìà Machine Learning Model (Optional)

* The trained model uses RandomForest + SMOTE
* Model runs in Python and integrates via prediction API or can be simulated
* Sample prediction result stored and consumed by Angular frontend

## üìö Future Improvements

* Push/email/SMS notification integration
* Role-based access (e.g., service providers)
* OBD-based real-time data sync via Bluetooth
* Payment logs and invoice generation
* Cloud deployment (Render, Netlify, MongoDB Atlas)

## ‚úÖ Tips for Uploading

1. Place the `README.md` file in the **root** of your Git repo.
2. Include optional screenshots in a `screenshots/` folder for GitHub rendering.
3. If you're using GitHub Pages or Firebase later, I can help with deployment steps too.

Would you like a `LICENSE` file or `.gitignore` for this too?
